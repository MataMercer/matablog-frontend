# MataBlog Web App

This is the front end application to [MataBlog](https://github.com/MataMercer/matablog). Built in NextJS, so if you're familiar with that, you're ready to go.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

NOTE: You need the API running along with PostGres to actually see any functionality.
